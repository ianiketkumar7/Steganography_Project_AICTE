# 🔒 Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography 🖼  

![Steganography](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT1XGXwdwICaPIhb0c/giphy.gif)  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements **image steganography**, allowing users to securely hide and retrieve secret messages within an image. Unlike traditional encryption, which makes the presence of secret data obvious, **steganography keeps the hidden message undetectable** within the image pixels.  

### 🔹 How It Works?  
- The message is embedded into an image at the pixel level.  
- A password-based authentication system ensures only authorized users can decrypt the hidden data.  
- The modified image appears unchanged but secretly contains the message.

## 🚀 Key Features  
✅ **Dual-Layer Security** – Message encoding + password protection  
✅ **Undetectable Message Hiding** – Data is concealed inside image pixels  
✅ **Minimal Image Distortion** – No noticeable changes to the original image  
✅ **Fast & Lightweight** – Runs efficiently with minimal system resources  
✅ **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
