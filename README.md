# 🔒 Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography 🖼  

![Steganography](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT1XGXwdwICaPIhb0c/giphy.gif)  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements **image steganography**, allowing users to securely hide and retrieve secret messages within an image. Unlike traditional encryption, which makes the presence of secret data obvious, **steganography keeps the hidden message undetectable** within the image pixels.  

### 🔹 How It Works?  
- The message is embedded into an image at the pixel level.  
- A password-based authentication system ensures only authorized users can decrypt the hidden data.  
- The modified image appears unchanged but secretly contains the message.

## 🚀 Key Features  
✅ **Dual-Layer Security** – Message encoding + password protection  
✅ **Undetectable Message Hiding** – Data is concealed inside image pixels  
✅ **Minimal Image Distortion** – No noticeable changes to the original image  
✅ **Fast & Lightweight** – Runs efficiently with minimal system resources  
✅ **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## 📂 Installation & Setup  

### 1️⃣ Install Python  
Make sure you have **Python 3+** installed. If not, download and install it from [Python’s official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  

### 2️⃣ Install Required Libraries  
Use the following command to install OpenCV:
pip install opencv-python

## 📝 How to Use?

### 1️⃣ Hiding a Secret Message in an Image
Run the script and provide the image file name (e.g., Kali.jpg).
Enter your secret message that you want to hide.
Set a password for decryption security.
The script will encode the message and generate an encrypted image (encryptedImage.jpg).

### 2️⃣ Retrieving the Hidden Message
Run the script again and enter the password for decryption.
If the password matches, the original message will be displayed.
If the password is incorrect, access is denied.
